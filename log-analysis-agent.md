## Use Case Overview
**Use Case Name:** Application Error Root Cause Analysis Agent  
**Business Domain:** Application Monitoring & Site Reliability Engineering  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Timeline:** 2-3 months

## Current State
**Problem Statement:** When application errors occur, logging systems trigger basic notifications to developers, but they must manually investigate logs, correlate events, and determine root causes, leading to prolonged incident resolution times.  
**Current Process:** Logging platforms detect error patterns and send alerts with basic error information. Developers then access log dashboards, search through logs, analyze stack traces, correlate with system metrics, and manually determine the root cause and resolution steps.  
**Pain Points:** Alert fatigue from non-actionable notifications, time-consuming manual log investigation (20-60 minutes per incident), difficulty correlating errors across multiple services, inconsistent troubleshooting approaches across team members.  
**Impact:** Average 40 minutes per critical error Ã— 8-12 daily errors = 5-8 hours of developer time daily; increased mean time to resolution (MTTR); potential customer impact from delayed fixes.

## Proposed AI Agent Solution
**Agent Type:** API-Powered Intelligent Alert Enhancement Agent  
**Core Functionality:** Intercept logging system error notifications, perform automated root cause analysis using LLMs, and deliver enriched notifications with structured issue resolution steps to developers.  
**Key Capabilities:** Logging platform integration and log retrieval, error context analysis, stack trace interpretation, service correlation analysis, structured resolution recommendations, integration with existing notification channels.  
**Integration Points:** OpenAI API or Claude API, logging platforms (ELK Stack, Splunk, Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch, etc.), existing notification systems (Slack, PagerDuty, email), APM tools, service discovery systems.

## Success Criteria
**Primary Objectives:** Reduce incident investigation time by 60%, improve MTTR by 40%, increase first-call resolution rate to 75%, reduce alert fatigue through actionable notifications.  
**Key Metrics:** Time from alert to root cause identification, accuracy of root cause analysis, developer satisfaction with enriched alerts, reduction in escalated incidents.  
**Expected Benefits:** Save 3-5 hours of developer time daily, faster incident resolution, improved system reliability, reduced on-call burden, better customer experience.  
**User Experience Goals:** Deliver enriched analysis within 3 minutes of original alert, achieve 80% accuracy in root cause identification, provide clear step-by-step resolution guidance.

## Implementation Considerations
**Technical Requirements:** API access to OpenAI or Claude services, logging platform API integration, webhook processing capabilities, secure API key management, structured notification templates.  
**User Groups:** Application developers, SRE engineers, on-call engineers, DevOps teams, incident response teams.  
**Training Data:** None required - leveraging pre-trained models. Will need prompt engineering with sample error logs and resolution patterns for optimization.  
**Potential Risks:** API rate limits during incident spikes, dependency on external AI services, potential for misleading analysis, integration complexity with existing alerting workflows, cost scaling with error volume.

## Resource Requirements
**Budget Estimate:** $20K-30K development cost, $8K-15K annual API usage cost (estimated 1000-2000 API calls/month)  
**Team Requirements:** Backend developer, SRE/DevOps engineer, prompt engineer (or developer with LLM experience)  
**Timeline:** Requirements & design (3 weeks), development (5-6 weeks), testing & integration (2-3 weeks)  
**Dependencies:** Logging platform API access, notification system integration capabilities, API access setup (OpenAI/Claude), prompt engineering and testing with production error patterns.
